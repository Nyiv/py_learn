## 1. **Introduce Terminal Basics**
Let’s start by practicing some basic terminal navigation. Open your terminal and try these commands (for Windows): 

- **`cd`** – Move into a folder (change directory).  
  Example:  
  ```cmd
  cd Documents
  ```
- **`cd ..`** – Move up one folder (to the parent directory).
- **`dir`** – List all files and folders in the current directory.
- **`mkdir folder_name`** – Create a new folder.  
  Example:  
  ```cmd
  mkdir py_learn
  ```
- **`cls`** – Clear the terminal screen.

> **Practice:** Use the above commands to navigate to a folder where you want to save your project, such as `Documents`.

## 2. **Clone the GitHub Repository**
1. Open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell).
2. Use the **`cd`** command to navigate to the folder where you want to save your project:  
   ```cmd
   cd Documents
   ```
   
3. Go to your GitHub repository and copy the **clone URL** (HTTPS).
4. In the terminal, run:  
   ```cmd
   git clone <paste-your-repo-URL-here>
   ```
   Example:  
   ```cmd
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```
5. Move into the project folder:  
   ```cmd
   cd repository-name
   ```

## 3. **Connect VSCode to GitHub**
Once your project folder is open in VSCode:

1. Open the **Source Control** tab (or press `Ctrl+Shift+G`).
2. Verify the repository is connected—you’ll see all your files.
3. Make a test change:
   - Open a file (like `daily_objectives.md`) and add a comment or some text.
   - Save the file (`Ctrl+S`).

4. Stage, commit, and push your changes:
   - Go to the **Source Control** tab:
     1. Click the **+** (Stage Changes).
     2. Type a commit message (e.g., “Test commit”).
     3. Click the **✔️** (Commit).
     4. Push your changes:
        - Click the **…** menu (top-right) → **Push**.

## 5. **Verify Your Work**
- Open your repository on the GitHub website.
- Confirm that your test changes are visible.

## 6. **Learning Actual Python**
- Create a new .py file in a new branch.
- We will start leaning syntax from here!
